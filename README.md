Explain2Me-Framework-Example
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

> This repo showcases the *Explain Me This: Salience-Based
> Explainability for Synthetic Face Detection Models* research codebase
> bundled with the tools and best practices developed by the frameworks
> group.

## Getting Started

To use this repo, clone it and run the following commands:

``` bash
pdm install
pdm run dvc repro
```

Documentation can be contributed to by editing the `nbs/` files then
running `pdm run nbdev_prepare`.

## Frameworks Approach

The frameworks team has added the following tools for explainability and
reproducability:

- PDM: for python package management
- DVC: for pipeline reproduceability
- nbdev: for code explainability

### DVC Pipeline and Experiments

Rather than re-creating an entire DVC Pipeleine, the frameworks team
focused in on `nbs/noise.ipynb` to display the DVC experiments feature
to allow code iterataions from the CLI or vscode plugin. To view the
full configuration please view `dvc.yaml`.

#### Running Experiments

Experiments can be run using the following methods:

**Command Line Interface**

Run the following command with the `-S` argument will run the pipeline
with the specified parameters.

``` bash
pdm run dvc exp run -S 'noise.amount=0.01'
```

**VSCode Plugin (Recommended)**

The DVC plugin for VSCode can be installed to provide an IDE for running
experiments, viewing plots, and changing parameters. Check out this
quick tutorial for an overview
